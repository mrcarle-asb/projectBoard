I want to easily offer students the ability to write a weird classroom tool or toy, both as an assignment and a IA.

ASB CS needs an estabish, well designed class "backend" so that those toys can CALL ON and USE clean abstractions like a Student who has  Student.id, Student.name, Student.asbemail, etc

The backend should be expansive enough to support a wide variety of applications. The material should be accessible via a basic API, and stored in a SQLite db file. Multiple versions of this db will live on the class repo, so that individual IA projects can build custom versions of the db file. This can happen without disrupting the use of a canonical /prod version of the service.


This is both a database, webdev project, but it also requires some syadmin / devops consideration. 

We have a 300€ startup budget and an ongoing spend of about 30€/month.
