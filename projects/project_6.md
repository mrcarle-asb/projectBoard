 Create a system of Hard Way / Follow Along lessons about how to arrange work spaces, move text, access files, and generally interact with the Unix-derived file system as software interface, and ergonmic UX.  
These are mini, tangible lessons:  
Make these folders
Arrange the windows on your desktop so that Instructions, Output and Editor are all visible at the same time.
Adjust window display values in Terminal
edit a .zshrc
CMD-TAB and CTRL-Tab and TAB in the browser.
---  I assert that there's a probably an infinite supply of these. 
This project might need to be split into backend and lesson content, but they need to start together.
The technical chalenge is: How to automate & judge "correctness"? Is that a CV problem?  Can we make instructions that specify particular background window colors that create a checksum-able screenshot?  Across all OSes?  


I have been a computer teacher for 25 years. For decades, you taught HOW to use the computer.  Mr >Ignasi and I can record a podcast about the specifics of that loss. 
I need something for that in CS.  I've called these "lab skills" in the past.  To extend that science class metaphor, think of these as the "mix these particular colors into 5 test tubes" as an grade5 "lab" that was 90% about pouring and stirring.

It's important to focus on working with APPLICATIONS on the host OS, as well as connecting to services through the shell and accessing web tools/platforms. I'm trying to correct common (bad) habits, notably allFullScreenSingleApp, that I put on iPad culture.

Previous attempts: bashcrawl, vaxmush, OS Petting Zoo,

Related Art: There are several "excercises" in the Hachette CS book for m27 that are "do some stuff with computers" These are great concepts. This Project Idea is anchoring the broad concept of "mechanizing," to borrow an Oracy term, those into lessons.

Challenges:    OS commonality. App / tool differences. 
This project can have any form. It needs to address HOW to use the computer, focusing on working on compound multiple app/window tasks.  
Is this just ignoring IDE's?   No.  This is trying to step zero IDEs.  You need to easily recognize "that's the system shell" and "that's the Python Repl" to use PyCharm or VS Code.

Ah!  There's a warmup sequence in here of "rate that hacker's desktop"
