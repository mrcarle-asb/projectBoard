# Half-Bakery ü•ñ

A lightweight project idea repository for sharing and discussing half-baked ideas in the classroom.

## What is this?

Half-Bakery is a simple web app where students can post early-stage project ideas and get feedback through comments. Think of it as a blog meets a forum, designed specifically for brainstorming and collaboration in an educational setting.

Each project starts as a text description‚Äîlike a rough draft of a README file. Other students can then comment, ask questions, and build on the ideas together.

## Features

- **Simple Project Pages**: Each project idea gets its own page with a description
- **Chronological Comments**: Discussion happens in a flat, easy-to-follow timeline
- **Quote-Style Replies**: Reply to specific comments with quoted text (like old-school forums)
- **No Login Required**: Perfect for classroom use‚Äîjust type your name
- **Local Network Access**: Runs on a Raspberry Pi, accessible to anyone on the local network

## Why "Half-Bakery"?

Projects posted here are "half-baked"‚Äînot fully thought through yet, and that's the point! This is a safe space for:
- Early brainstorming
- Rough ideas that need feedback
- "What if we..." style thinking
- Learning to give and receive constructive comments

## Technical Overview

Built with:
- Flask (Python web framework)
- SQLite (for comments and project metadata)
- Plain text/markdown files (for project descriptions)

The design keeps project descriptions as actual files on disk rather than in the database, making them easy to edit, backup, and version control if needed.

## Educational Goals

This project teaches:
- How web applications store and retrieve data
- The difference between file storage and database storage
- Basic API design and routing
- How threaded discussions work under the hood
- Collaborative ideation in a digital space

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **In Development** - This project is currently being specified and built as a classroom teaching tool.
