A backend that maintains student balance, with API calls for basic CRUD options 
(add to balance, deduct from balance, delete user, add user).

This should exists as the foudnation for other "class action" tasks that have a reward or price expressed in this hypothetical currency. 

These routes can be called in other applications. Their API functionality is more important than their user-facing parts.
